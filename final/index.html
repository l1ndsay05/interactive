    <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
    <p>For our final project, we propose creating a horror puzzle game designed for VR or AR platforms, inspired by the gameplay mechanics of The Mimic on Roblox. The game will feature multiple intricate mazes and puzzles, challenging players to navigate and solve tasks while being chased by a scary entity. Jump scares will be strategically incorporated when players interact with certain elements, such as opening doors or being caught by the entity. The game will utilize a first-person perspective, immersing players deeply into the horror experience.
    </p>
    <p>To heighten the experience, the mazes will include dynamic environmental changes triggered by player actions, such as shifting walls, dimming lights, or eerie audio cues, adding unpredictability and suspense. The puzzles will range in complexity, requiring players to think critically while managing the fear of being caught. The game's vibe will focus on a dark, atmospheric aesthetic, with free 3D models found on websites. In order to bolster the immersive experience of this game, we project we will have to incorporate the use of some kind of tracking mechanism, either it be hand tracking or even sensors to get the player to move in real life while playing the game. Current questions we have for the feasibility of this game is how we can incorporate jump scares and animations into the AR space, and what mechanics will be used for the player to traverse the environment (ie. WASD, in-real-life movement, etc). 
    </p>
    <p>In order for the player to beat the game, they are required to complete the puzzles and navigate through the maze without being caught by a scary entity. The game will be largely fast paced, with the scary entity gaining and losing aggro periodically to allow the player the space to solve tasks without removing the suspense. Given that the player does have to run away relatively frequently, we plan to make the puzzles relatively easy and recurring, so players can place more focus on navigating the maze.
